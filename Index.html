        <h2>About Contractorology</h2>
        <p>At Contractorology, we believe in delivering quality and reliability. The name Contractorology embodies the science and art of contracting, bringing together expertise, precision, and dedication to every project we undertake.</p>
        <p>Brandon, the owner, started his career with the town's parks and recreation department, managing parks and facilities with a dedicated crew. He was later promoted to lead the construction of a $10.5 million park, featuring a disc golf course, trails, a large lake, and a beautiful waterfall.</p>
        <p>Brandon then launched his own handyman business, Lightning Handyman. Seeking further growth, he joined a company building indoor trampoline parks worldwide, progressing from an installer to a superintendent managing multi-million dollar projects. Brandon eventually led his own team, installing colorful epoxy floors across the country.</p>
        <p>Returning to entrepreneurship, Brandon founded Contractorology, a general contracting company that has assisted in building Amazon warehouses in the PNW and completed various other significant projects.</p>
